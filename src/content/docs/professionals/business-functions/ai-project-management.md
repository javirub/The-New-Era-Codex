# AI for Project Management

## AI Applications in PM

### Planning
- Project breakdown
- Timeline estimation
- Resource allocation
- Dependency mapping

### Execution
- Status updates
- Risk monitoring
- Meeting summaries
- Action item tracking

### Analysis
- Performance metrics
- Predictive analytics
- Retrospective insights
- Improvement recommendations

## AI PM Tools

- **Motion**: AI-powered scheduling
- **Trevor**: Intelligent task management
- **Reclaim**: Calendar optimization
- **Asana Intelligence**: Smart workflows

## Project Planning with AI

```
Prompt: "Break down this project:

Goal: [Project goal]
Timeline: [Duration]
Team: [Size and roles]
Constraints: [Budget, resources]

Provide:
- Work breakdown structure (WBS)
- Key milestones with dates
- Critical path
- Resource allocation
- Risk factors
- Success metrics"
```

## Risk Assessment

```
Prompt: "Analyze project risks:

Project details: [Description]
Team experience: [Level]
Dependencies: [List]
Timeline: [Duration]

For each risk:
- Probability (H/M/L)
- Impact (H/M/L)
- Mitigation strategy
- Contingency plan"
```

## Meeting Efficiency

**Pre-meeting AI prep**:
```
Prompt: "Prepare for project meeting:
- Review last meeting notes: [notes]
- Current sprint status: [status]
- Key decisions needed: [list]

Create:
- Agenda
- Discussion prompts
- Decision framework"
```

**Post-meeting processing**:
```
Prompt: "Process meeting notes:
[paste transcript/notes]

Extract:
- Decisions made
- Action items (owner, due date)
- Parking lot items
- Next meeting agenda items"
```

## Best Practices

✅ **Do**:
- Use AI for initial planning
- Validate estimates with team
- Update AI context regularly
- Combine AI with PM tools
- Human review critical decisions

❌ **Don't**:
- Blindly follow AI timelines
- Skip team input
- Ignore context
- Over-automate communication
