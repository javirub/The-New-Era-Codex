## Key Considerations

**Finance & Accounting**:
- Maintain audit trails for all AI-assisted transactions
- Implement human review for material entries
- Ensure SOX compliance for public companies
- Document AI decision-making processes

**Legal**:
- Never rely solely on AI for legal advice
- Verify all citations and case references
- Maintain attorney-client privilege
- Follow bar association AI guidelines

**Compliance**:
- Regular model validation and testing
- Documentation of AI training data
- Explainability for regulatory inquiries
- Incident response procedures

<Aside type="note">
Many organizations require legal/compliance approval before deploying AI in these functions. Check your internal policies first.
