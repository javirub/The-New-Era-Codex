- [Opportunity cost or strategic limitation]

**Example scenario**:

[Concrete example with numbers]
> "For a company hiring 20 positions per year with 100 applicants each, HR spends 200+ hours on initial screening alone—equivalent to 5 weeks of full-time work."

## The Solution

- [ ] [Requirement 2]
- [ ] [Requirement 3]

**Nice-to-Have Qualifications** (Bonus points):
- [ ] [Qualification 1]
- [ ] [Qualification 2]
- [ ] [Qualification 3]

**Template for defining criteria**:

| Category | Requirement | Weight | How to Verify |
|----------|-------------|--------|---------------|
| [Category] | [Specific requirement] | High/Medium/Low | [Method] |
| [Category] | [Specific requirement] | High/Medium/Low | [Method] |

### Step 2: Create Your Process Template

**The template you'll use**:

```
[Provide a business-focused template or prompt they can adapt]

For example, for candidate screening:

Analyze this resume for a [Job Title] position.

Must-have requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

Nice-to-have qualifications:
- [Qualification 1]
- [Qualification 2]

Provide:
1. Match score (0-100) with justification
2. Brief summary of relevant experience
3. Potential concerns or gaps
4. Recommendation (Strong Yes/Yes/Maybe/No)

Format your response as structured data for our tracking system.
```

</details>

### Step 4: Review and Validate Results

**Human review process**:

1. **AI provides**: [What the AI output includes]
2. **You review for**: [What human judgment adds]
3. **Final decision**: [Who decides and based on what]

**Quality checklist**:
