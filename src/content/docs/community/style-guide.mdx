# Style Guide

This guide ensures consistency across all content in The New Era Codex. Follow these guidelines when creating or editing content.

## Frontmatter Standards

Every page must include frontmatter at the top of the file:

```yaml
---
title: "Your Page Title"
description: "Brief description for SEO and previews (140-160 characters)"
sidebar:
  order: 1              # Optional: controls position in sidebar
  badge:                # Optional: add visual badges
    text: "New"
    variant: tip        # Options: note, tip, caution, danger
---
```

### Title Guidelines

- **Use sentence case**: "Building your first RAG system" (not "Building Your First RAG System")
- **Be specific**: "Create an email classifier in n8n" (not "Email automation")
- **Avoid jargon in titles**: Prefer clarity over cleverness
- **Keep it concise**: 3-8 words ideal

### Description Guidelines

- **140-160 characters** for optimal SEO
- **Include the benefit**: "Learn how to..." or "Reduce time by..."
- **Mention the audience** if not obvious from directory
- **No ending period**

**Good examples**:
```yaml
description: "Build a production-ready RAG system using LangChain and Pinecone in under 30 minutes"
description: "Reduce resume screening time by 70% with AI-powered candidate evaluation"
description: "Master ChatGPT prompt engineering with simple techniques anyone can use"
```

**Bad examples**:
```yaml
description: "RAG systems" # Too vague
description: "This guide will teach you everything you need to know about building RAG systems with vector databases and embeddings." # Too long
description: "The ultimate guide to RAG." # Clickbait, ends with period
```

## Tone by Audience

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Developers">
    **Voice**: Technical, direct, assumes coding knowledge

    **Do**:
    - Use technical terminology without over-explaining
    - Link to official documentation
    - Show code-first, explain after
    - Discuss tradeoffs and performance

    **Don't**:
    - Explain basic programming concepts
    - Use non-technical analogies
    - Over-simplify architecture decisions

    **Example**:
    ```markdown
    Initialize the vector store with OpenAI embeddings:

    ```python
    from langchain.vectorstores import Pinecone
    embeddings = OpenAIEmbeddings(model="text-embedding-3-small")
    vectorstore = Pinecone.from_documents(docs, embeddings, index_name="my-index")
    ```

    This approach uses the newer `text-embedding-3-small` model, which offers
    better performance at lower cost compared to `text-embedding-ada-002`.
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Automation">
    **Voice**: Friendly, step-by-step, visual, assumes no coding knowledge

    **Do**:
    - Use numbered steps
    - Include screenshots with annotations
    - Explain what each step does
    - Provide downloadable workflow files

    **Don't**:
    - Assume technical knowledge
    - Skip "obvious" steps
    - Use code without explanation

    **Example**:
    ```markdown
    ## Step 3: Add the OpenAI Node

    Now you'll add the AI component that analyzes your emails.

    1. Click the **+** button on the canvas
    2. Search for "OpenAI" in the node selector
    3. Select **"OpenAI Chat Model"**

    [Screenshot showing where to click, with arrows]

    **What this does**: This node sends your email text to OpenAI's AI model
    and receives a response with the email category.
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Everyone">
    **Voice**: Accessible, jargon-free, encouraging, conversational

    **Do**:
    - Explain terms the first time they appear
    - Use everyday analogies
    - Provide copy-paste examples
    - Celebrate small wins

    **Don't**:
    - Use unexplained jargon
    - Assume prior AI knowledge
    - Make it feel complicated

    **Example**:
    ```markdown
    ## What is a "Prompt"?

    A prompt is simply the instruction you give to ChatGPT. Think of it like
    ordering at a restaurant: the more specific you are, the more likely you'll
    get exactly what you want.

    **Vague order**: "I'll have pasta"
    **Specific order**: "I'll have the spaghetti carbonara, extra crispy bacon,
    light on the cheese"

    Same idea with ChatGPT:

    **Vague prompt**: "Write about productivity"
    **Specific prompt**: "Write 5 productivity tips for parents working from home,
    each under 50 words, with practical examples"
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="Professionals">
    **Voice**: Business-focused, role-specific, ROI-conscious, compliance-aware

    **Do**:
    - Lead with business impact
    - Include metrics and ROI
    - Address compliance/privacy
    - Provide role-specific templates

    **Don't**:
    - Include technical implementation details
    - Ignore business constraints
    - Skip compliance considerations

    **Example**:
    ```markdown
    ## Business Impact

    **Time Saved**: 2 hours per candidate evaluation
    **Cost Reduction**: $150 per hire in HR time
    **Quality Improvement**: 40% more consistent evaluations
    **Compliance Benefit**: Complete audit trail of evaluation criteria

    ## Privacy Considerations

    Before implementing AI screening:
    - ✅ Ensure candidate consent for AI processing
    - ✅ Document evaluation criteria for audits
    - ✅ Maintain human oversight for final decisions
    - ✅ Check GDPR/CCPA compliance with legal team
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Markdown Formatting

### Headings

Use ATX-style headers with proper hierarchy:

```markdown
# Page Title (H1) - Only one per page, usually automatic from frontmatter

## Main Sections (H2)

### Subsections (H3)

#### Minor subsections (H4) - Use sparingly
```

**Don't skip levels**: H2 → H4 breaks document structure.

### Code Blocks

Always specify the language for syntax highlighting:

````markdown
```python
def hello():
    return "Hello, World!"
```

```bash
bun install
bun dev
```

```javascript
const greeting = "Hello, World!";
console.log(greeting);
```
````

For terminal output without syntax highlighting:

````markdown
```text
Output from command
```
````

### Lists

**Unordered lists**: Use `-` (not `*` or `+`) for consistency

```markdown
- First item
- Second item
  - Nested item (2 spaces)
  - Another nested item
- Third item
```

**Ordered lists**: Use `1.` for all items (auto-numbering)

```markdown
1. First step
1. Second step
1. Third step
```

### Links

**Internal links**: Use relative paths without `.md` or `.mdx` extension

```markdown
[See our contribution guide](/community/contributing/)
[Developer guides](/developers/)
```

**External links**: Include `https://` and open in new tab isn't needed (Starlight handles this)

```markdown
[LangChain documentation](https://docs.langchain.com)
```

### Images

Store images in `src/assets/` for optimization:

```markdown
![Alt text describing the image](../../assets/screenshot.png)
```

For frontmatter hero images:

```yaml
---
title: My Guide
hero:
  image:
    file: ../../assets/hero.webp
    alt: "Descriptive alt text"
---
```

## Starlight Components

Import components at the top of `.mdx` files:

```mdx
---
title: My Guide
---

import { Card, CardGrid, Tabs, TabItem, Aside, Steps, Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
```

### Cards

Use for feature highlights or grouped information:

```mdx
<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Feature One" icon="rocket">
    Description of the feature
  </Card>

  <Card title="Feature Two" icon="star">
    Another feature description
  </Card>
</CardGrid>
```

**Available icons**: rocket, star, pencil, setting, laptop, approve-check, warning, information, etc.
[See full icon list](https://starlight.astro.build/guides/components/#available-icons)

### Tabs

Perfect for showing audience-specific content or alternative approaches:

````mdx
<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Python">
    ```python
    print("Hello")
    ```
  </TabItem>

  <TabItem label="JavaScript">
    ```javascript
    console.log("Hello")
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
````

### Asides (Callouts)

Use for important notes, tips, warnings:

```mdx
<Aside>
Default note
</Aside>

<Aside type="tip">
Helpful tip for readers
</Aside>

<Aside type="caution">
Important warning or caveat
</Aside>

<Aside type="danger">
Critical warning - risk of data loss, security issue, etc.
</Aside>
```

**When to use each**:
- `note` (default): Supplementary information
- `tip`: Helpful shortcuts or best practices
- `caution`: Important warnings, gotchas
- `danger`: Critical issues, security risks, data loss potential

### Steps

For sequential processes:

````mdx
<Steps>

1. **First Step**

   Explanation of what to do

   ```bash
   command to run
   ```

2. **Second Step**

   More details here

3. **Third Step**

   Final instructions

</Steps>
````

<Aside type="tip">
The `<Steps>` component automatically numbers and styles your list. Use it for any multi-step process!
</Aside>

## File Naming

### URLs Are Permanent

File paths become URLs. Once published, changing a file path breaks links.

**Good file names**:
- `langchain-rag-guide.md` → `/developers/langchain-rag-guide/`
- `n8n-email-classifier.md` → `/automation/n8n-email-classifier/`
- `chatgpt-prompts-basics.md` → `/everyone/chatgpt-prompts-basics/`

**Bad file names**:
- `guide1.md` - Not descriptive
- `RAG_System_Guide.md` - Use kebab-case, not snake_case or PascalCase
- `the-ultimate-guide-to-rag.md` - Avoid "ultimate" and be concise

### Directory Structure

Files are organized by **audience first**:

```
src/content/docs/
├── developers/
│   ├── agents/
│   │   └── guide.md
│   └── rag/
│       └── langchain.md
├── automation/
│   ├── n8n/
│   └── zapier/
├── everyone/
│   ├── chatgpt/
│   └── prompts/
└── professionals/
    ├── hr/
    └── marketing/
```

## Code Examples

### All Code Must Be Tested

Before submitting:
- ✅ Run the code yourself
- ✅ Verify it works with current versions
- ✅ Include necessary imports
- ✅ Specify version requirements if relevant

### Include Context

**Bad**:
```python
result = chain.run(query)
```

**Good**:
```python
from langchain.chains import RetrievalQA

# Initialize the QA chain with our vector store
qa_chain = RetrievalQA.from_chain_type(
    llm=llm,
    retriever=vectorstore.as_retriever(),
    chain_type="stuff"
)

# Run a query
result = qa_chain.run("What are the key features?")
print(result)
```

### Environment Variables

Never include real API keys. Use placeholders:

**Bad**:
```python
openai.api_key = "sk-proj-abc123xyz"
```

**Good**:
```python
import os
openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
```

And remind readers to set them:

```markdown
Create a `.env` file:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here
PINECONE_API_KEY=your-key-here
```

Never commit `.env` files to version control!
```

## Multilingual Considerations

### Currently: English Only

All content is currently in English. However, the structure is prepared for Spanish (and more languages).

### Future: Spanish Translations

When translating:
- Keep the same file structure: `es/developers/` mirrors `en/developers/`
- Translate file names too: `langchain-rag-guide.md` → `guia-rag-langchain.md`
- Adapt examples to be culturally relevant
- Maintain the same audience-specific tone

### Translation Priority

When Spanish support launches, prioritize:
1. **Everyone** content - Most accessible to Spanish speakers
2. **Professionals** content - High business value
3. **Automation** content - Visual, easier to translate
4. **Developers** content - International audience already uses English

## Common Mistakes

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="❌ Mixing Audiences" icon="warning">
    **Don't**: Write a guide that's half technical, half beginner

    **Do**: Create separate guides for different audiences
  </Card>

  <Card title="❌ Untested Code" icon="warning">
    **Don't**: Copy code from Stack Overflow without testing

    **Do**: Run every code example before publishing
  </Card>

  <Card title="❌ Skipping Prerequisites" icon="warning">
    **Don't**: Assume readers have accounts/API keys

    **Do**: List prerequisites upfront with links
  </Card>

  <Card title="❌ Vague Benefits" icon="warning">
    **Don't**: "This guide will help you with productivity"

    **Do**: "Reduce email triage time by 2 hours per week"
  </Card>
</CardGrid>

## Accessibility

### Alt Text for Images

Always include descriptive alt text:

```markdown
![Screenshot showing the n8n workflow editor with a Gmail trigger node connected to an OpenAI node](../../assets/n8n-workflow.png)
```

**Not**: `![screenshot](image.png)`

### Heading Hierarchy

Don't skip heading levels - screen readers rely on proper structure:

**Bad**:
```markdown
# Title
### Subsection (skipped H2!)
```

**Good**:
```markdown
# Title
## Main Section
### Subsection
```

### Link Text

Use descriptive link text, not "click here":

**Bad**: "Click [here](https://example.com) to learn more"

**Good**: "Learn more about [RAG architecture](https://example.com)"
