<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Developers">
    **Your audience**: Software engineers, data scientists, ML engineers

    **Tone**: Technical, assumes coding knowledge

    **Topics**: AI agents, RAG systems, LangChain, Python development, APIs, vector databases

    **What to include**:
    - Working code examples with explanations
    - Architecture diagrams
    - GitHub repository patterns
    - Technical best practices
    - Performance considerations

    **Example opening**: "In this guide, we'll build a RAG system using LangChain and Pinecone. You'll need Python 3.9+, an OpenAI API key, and familiarity with async/await patterns."
  </TabItem>

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

<Aside type="tip">
**Quick test**: If you can't clearly identify which single audience your guide is for, you probably need to split it into multiple guides or refocus your content.
</Aside>

## Before You Start

<Aside type="caution" title="Language Requirement">
**IMPORTANT**: All new guides **must be written in English**. Spanish translations (or other languages) are optional and highly encouraged, but English is mandatory.

- ✅ English version is required for all new content
- ✅ Spanish translation is optional but welcomed
- ✅ Other language translations are welcome as the project grows

This ensures all contributors and maintainers can review content, while still supporting our multilingual mission.
</Aside>

### Translation File Naming Conventions

When creating translations, **you must use the same filename as the English version**. This is required for Starlight to properly link translations together.

**Correct Structure:**
```
src/content/docs/
├── automation/
│   └── first-ai-workflow-n8n.md          (English)
└── es/
    └── automation/
        └── first-ai-workflow-n8n.md      (Spanish translation)
```

**Important Rules:**

1. **Same Filename**: Translation files must have the **exact same filename** as the English version
   - ✅ `automation/first-ai-workflow-n8n.md` → `es/automation/first-ai-workflow-n8n.md`
   - ❌ `automation/first-ai-workflow-n8n.md` → `es/automation/primer-workflow-ia-n8n.md`

2. **Same Directory Structure**: Maintain the same folder hierarchy
   - ✅ `developers/building-first-rag-system.md` → `es/developers/building-first-rag-system.md`
   - ❌ `developers/building-first-rag-system.md` → `es/desarrolladores/building-first-rag-system.md`

3. **Match Frontmatter Order**: If the English file has `sidebar: { order: 10 }`, the translation should too
   - This ensures consistent navigation ordering across languages

4. **Translate Content, Not Filenames**: Keep filenames in English, translate the actual content inside
   - The `title` field in frontmatter should be translated
   - The file content should be fully translated
   - Only the filename stays in English

**Example:**

English file (`automation/first-ai-workflow-n8n.md`):
```markdown
---
title: "Your First AI Workflow with n8n"
description: "Visual guide to connect OpenAI to n8n"
sidebar:
  order: 10
---
# Your First AI Workflow with n8n
...
```

Spanish translation (`es/automation/first-ai-workflow-n8n.md`):
```markdown
---
title: "Tu Primer Workflow de IA con n8n"
description: "Guía visual para conectar OpenAI a n8n"
sidebar:
  order: 10
---
# Tu Primer Workflow de IA con n8n
...
```

title: Write Better ChatGPT Prompts in 5 Minutes
description: Simple techniques anyone can use to get better AI responses
---

# Write Better ChatGPT Prompts

## Why This Matters

Have you ever asked ChatGPT a question and gotten a vague, unhelpful answer? You're not alone. The secret isn't ChatGPT—it's how you ask.

In the next 5 minutes, you'll learn a simple formula that works every time.

## The Problem: Vague Prompts Get Vague Answers

### Bad Prompt
```
Write me a blog post about productivity
```

**What you get**: A generic, boring article that could be about anything

### Good Prompt
```
Write a 500-word blog post about productivity tips for remote workers with young children. Use a friendly, conversational tone. Include 3 specific strategies with examples. The audience is parents working from home who struggle with interruptions.
```

**What you get**: A focused, useful article that actually helps people

## The 5-Minute Formula

Every good prompt needs these 4 parts:

1. **What** you want (blog post, email, summary, etc.)
2. **Who** it's for (beginners, experts, parents, etc.)
3. **How** it should sound (formal, casual, funny, etc.)
4. **Specifics** (length, examples, format, etc.)

## Try It Yourself

### Example 1: Writing an Email

**Bad**: "Write an email to my boss"

**Good**: "Write a professional email to my boss requesting next Friday off. I need it for a family event. Keep it brief and polite, around 100 words."

**Copy this template**:
```
Write a [tone] email to [recipient] about [topic].
[Any specific requirements]. Keep it [length] and [style].
```

title: AI-Powered Candidate Screening for HR Teams
description: Reduce resume review time by 70% while improving hiring consistency
---

# AI-Powered Candidate Screening

## Business Impact

**Time Saved**: ~2 hours per position
**Cost Reduction**: ~$150 per hire in HR time
**Quality Improvement**: 40% more consistent candidate evaluation

## Who This Is For

This guide is designed for HR professionals and recruiters who:
- Review 20+ resumes per position
- Struggle with inconsistent evaluation criteria
- Need to reduce time-to-hire
- Want to maintain compliance with hiring regulations

## The Problem

Traditional resume screening is:
- Time-consuming (average 6 minutes per resume)
- Inconsistent (different reviewers use different criteria)
- Biased (unconscious biases affect decisions)
- Unscalable (100+ applicants = days of work)

## The Solution

Use AI to create a consistent, fast initial screening that:
- Applies the same criteria to every candidate
- Flags top matches for human review
- Documents reasoning for compliance
- Reduces screening time by 70%

## How It Works

### Step 1: Define Your Criteria

Work with hiring managers to list must-have and nice-to-have qualifications:

**Must-Have (Deal-breakers)**:
- 3+ years in role
- Specific certifications
- Required skills

**Nice-to-Have (Bonus points)**:
- Relevant industry experience
- Additional languages
- Leadership experience

### Step 2: Create Your Screening Prompt

```
Analyze this resume for a [Job Title] position.

Must-have requirements:
- [Requirement 1]
- [Requirement 2]
- [Requirement 3]

Nice-to-have qualifications:
- [Qualification 1]
- [Qualification 2]

Provide:
1. Match score (0-100)
2. Brief summary of relevant experience
3. Potential concerns
4. Recommendation (Strong Yes/Yes/Maybe/No)
```

### Step 3: Review AI Assessments

[Include example output]

## Important Considerations

### Privacy & Compliance

- **GDPR/Data Privacy**: Ensure candidate consent for AI processing
- **Anti-Discrimination**: AI should evaluate qualifications, not demographics
- **Documentation**: Keep records of evaluation criteria for audits
- **Human Review**: AI screens, humans decide—never automate final decisions

### Best Practices

1. **Validate Regularly**: Audit AI recommendations quarterly
2. **Train Your Team**: Ensure HR understands how AI evaluations work
3. **Be Transparent**: Tell candidates AI is part of the process
4. **Iterate**: Refine criteria based on hiring outcomes

## Measuring Success

Track these metrics to measure impact:

| Metric | Before AI | After AI | Improvement |
|--------|-----------|----------|-------------|
| Time per resume | 6 min | 2 min | 67% reduction |
| Time to first interview | 5 days | 2 days | 60% faster |
| Evaluation consistency | 65% | 92% | 42% better |
