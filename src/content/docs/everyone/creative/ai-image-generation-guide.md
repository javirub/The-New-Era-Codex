## Platform-Specific Tips

### DALL-E 3 (ChatGPT)

**Best practices**:
- Use natural language, ChatGPT refines it
- Ask for variations: "Show me 3 different versions"
- Request specific changes: "Make the sky more dramatic"
- Combine with text: "Add the text 'Welcome' at the top"

**Example conversation**:
```
User: Create a logo for a coffee shop called "Morning Brew"
ChatGPT: [generates image]
User: Make it more vintage, add coffee beans
ChatGPT: [generates revised version]
```

### Midjourney

**Basic command**:
```
/imagine [prompt] --parameter value
```

**Useful parameters**:
- `--ar 16:9` (aspect ratio)
- `--v 6` (version 6, latest)
- `--stylize 100` (0-1000, how artistic)
- `--chaos 50` (0-100, variation)

**Example**:
```
/imagine futuristic city at night, cyberpunk, neon lights,
highly detailed --ar 16:9 --v 6 --stylize 250
```

**Upscale & Variations**:
- Click U1-U4 to upscale
- Click V1-V4 for variations
- 🔄 to reroll all

### Stable Diffusion

**Prompt structure**:
```
Main prompt, details, style
Negative prompt: things to avoid
```

**Example**:
```
Prompt: portrait of woman, elegant dress, garden background,
soft lighting, oil painting style, highly detailed, masterpiece

Negative: blurry, low quality, distorted, ugly, bad anatomy
```

**Key settings**:
- **Steps**: 20-50 (higher = more refined)
- **CFG Scale**: 7-12 (how closely follows prompt)
- **Sampler**: Euler a, DPM++ (affects style)

## Common Mistakes & Fixes

### Problem: Vague Results

❌ **Bad**: "A dog"
✅ **Good**: "Golden retriever puppy playing in autumn leaves, warm afternoon light, close-up, photorealistic"

### Problem: Too Complex

❌ **Bad**: "A knight fighting a dragon while riding a horse in a castle with a princess watching from a tower during sunset with mountains in background"
✅ **Good**: "Medieval knight on horseback facing a red dragon, castle courtyard, dramatic sunset lighting, fantasy art"

**Tip**: Focus on one main subject, keep it clear

### Problem: Wrong Style

❌ **Bad**: Just describing content without style
✅ **Good**: Always specify: photorealistic, illustration, 3D render, painting, etc.

### Problem: Unwanted Elements

**Fix**: Use negative prompts or be more specific

❌ "Portrait of a person"  (might get extra hands/limbs)
✅ "Professional headshot portrait, one person, natural pose, clean background"

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Copyright

**AI-generated images**:
- Generally not copyrighted in many jurisdictions
- Check platform's terms (varies by tool)

**Using AI art commercially**:
- Read platform terms carefully
- DALL-E: You own images
- Midjourney: Depends on subscription tier
- Stable Diffusion: Open license

### Ethical Use

**Do**:
✅ Disclose when using AI-generated images
✅ Use for inspiration and drafts
✅ Combine with human creativity
✅ Respect existing artists' styles

**Don't**:
❌ Impersonate real people without consent
❌ Create misleading content
❌ Violate platform content policies
❌ Use for harmful purposes
