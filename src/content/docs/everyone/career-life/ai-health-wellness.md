## Important Disclaimers

⚠️ **Critical**: AI is NOT:
- A doctor
- A licensed nutritionist
- A therapist
- A replacement for medical care

✅ **AI CAN**:
- Provide general information
- Help organize thoughts
- Suggest common approaches
- Track progress
- Motivate and support

**Always**:
- Consult healthcare professionals
- Verify medical information
- Disclose to your doctor
- Emergency = call 911
- Mental crisis = call hotline
