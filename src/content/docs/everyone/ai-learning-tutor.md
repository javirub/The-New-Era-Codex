# AI as Your Personal Tutor

## The Feynman Technique

**Learning through teaching**:
```
Explain [quantum physics/machine learning/economics] to me as if I'm 10 years old.

Start with the absolute basics, use analogies from everyday life, and build up complexity slowly.
```

**Why this works**: If AI can explain it simply, you'll understand it deeply.

## Customized Learning Paths

**Skill roadmap**:
```
I want to learn [web development/photography/Spanish] from scratch.

Create a 90-day learning path with:
- Week-by-week progression
- Specific daily tasks (30-60 min)
- Milestone projects
- Resources for each stage
- How to know when I'm ready to advance

Current level: Complete beginner
Learning style: Hands-on, practical examples
```

## Breaking Down Complex Topics

**ELI5 (Explain Like I'm 5)**:
```
I'm reading about blockchain but don't get it. Explain it using:
- A simple analogy
- Step-by-step process
- Why it matters
- Common misconceptions to avoid
```

**Progressive complexity**:
```
Explain photosynthesis in 3 versions:
1. For a 5-year-old
2. For a high school student
3. For a college biology major

I'll tell you which level I understand, and we'll build from there.
```

## Active Recall & Quizzing

**Practice questions**:
```
I'm studying [World War II/calculus/Python programming].

Create 10 quiz questions that:
- Test real understanding, not just memorization
- Range from basic to advanced
- Include explanations for correct answers
- Identify common mistakes
```

**Spaced repetition helper**:
```
I'm learning Spanish vocabulary. Here are 20 words I studied this week:
[list words]

Create a review schedule:
- When to review (today, 2 days, 1 week, 1 month)
- Quiz me with different question types
- Mix in old words I should still remember
```

## Study Techniques

**Note summarization**:
```
Here are my class notes from today's lecture on [topic]:

[paste notes]

- Main concept in center
- Key subtopics branching out
- How concepts connect to each other
- Real-world applications
```

## Language Learning

**Conversation practice**:
```
Let's have a conversation in Spanish about ordering food at a restaurant.

Rules:
- You play the waiter, I'm the customer
- Keep it to A2 level (beginner)
- If I make a mistake, gently correct me
- Ask follow-up questions to keep it going
```

**Grammar clarification**:
```
I keep confusing [ser vs. estar / who vs. whom / past perfect vs. simple past].

Explain:
- The actual difference
- Simple rule to remember when to use each
- 5 example sentences for each
- A trick to remember it
```

## Math & Science

**Step-by-step problem solving**:
```
Solve this calculus problem, but show me every single step:

[problem]

For each step, explain:
- What you're doing
- Why you're doing it
- What rule/formula you're using
```

**Word problems**:
```
I struggle with word problems. Here's one:

[problem]

Help me:
1. Identify what the problem is asking
2. What information is given
3. What formula/approach to use
4. Step-by-step solution
5. How to check if my answer makes sense
```

## Test Preparation

**Study plan**:
```
I have an exam in 2 weeks on [subject]. Topics covered:
- [Topic 1]
- [Topic 2]
- [Topic 3]

Create a study schedule that:
- Covers all topics
- Includes active recall
- Builds to practice tests
- Leaves time for review
- Accounts for 2 hours/day study time
```

**Practice exams**:
```
Create a practice exam for [subject] that:
- Matches the format of [SAT/AP/college final/certification]
- Tests key concepts
- Includes time limits
- Has detailed answer explanations
```

## Research Skills

**Topic exploration**:
```
I need to write a research paper on [climate change/artificial intelligence/Renaissance art].

Help me:
1. Narrow down to a specific angle
2. Develop a thesis statement
3. Outline main arguments
4. Suggest types of sources to look for
5. Identify potential counterarguments
```

[paste long article]

Then ask me questions to check if I understood the key ideas.
```

## Memory Techniques

**Mnemonics**:
```
I need to memorize [order of planets/periodic table/historical dates].

```

**Debugging understanding**:
```
I think I understand [concept], but I'm not sure.

Ask me questions to test my understanding and identify gaps. Start basic and get progressively harder. Tell me where my mental model is wrong.
```
